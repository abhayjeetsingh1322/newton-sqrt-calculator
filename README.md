# Newton Square Root Calculator

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of Newton's method to calculate the square root of a positive number with high precision. The functionality evolves across four versions, showcasing iterative improvements and additional features.

## Objectives
- Practice using `double` variables, while loops, and static methods.
- Gain familiarity with Eclipse IDE features such as refactoring, creating files, and managing projects.
- Implement Newton's method for estimating square roots with a relative error of less than 0.01%.

## Versions
1. **Newton1**:
   - Calculates square roots based on user input.
   - Uses a static method `sqrt(double x)` to compute the estimate.

2. **Newton2**:
   - Adds support for `x = 0` without encountering division by zero errors.

3. **Newton3**:
   - Allows the user to specify the value of Îµ (precision) at runtime.

4. **Newton4**:
   - Simplifies user interaction by interpreting negative input as a signal to quit.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Eclipse IDE
